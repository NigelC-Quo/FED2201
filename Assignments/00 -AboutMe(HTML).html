            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p> Hi! My name is Nigel Clayton, i'm 24 years old and live in Decatur GA.
                I got into coding by taking a HTML elective class in my senior year of highschool and thought
                it was very fun to learn. After highschool, I initially decided to pursue a graphic design degree
                at Kennesaw State University before changing it Game Design and Development in my first year there.
                During my 4 years there leading to graduation, I learned a lot about Java, not really liking at first 
                but warmed up to it later, made board games before designing games in Unity with C#, and learning time 
                management and working with and communicating with a team to reach milestones. 
            </p>
