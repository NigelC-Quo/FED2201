            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p> Hi! My name is Nigel Clayton, i'm 24 years old and live in Decatur GA. <br>
                I got into coding by taking a HTML elective class in my senior year of <br>
                highschool and thought it was very fun to learn. After highschool, I initially <br>
                decided to pursue a graphic design degree at <u>Kennesaw State University</u> before <br>
                changing it Game Design and Development in my first year there. During my 4 years <br>
                there leading to graduation, I learned a lot about Java, not really liking at first <br>
                but warmed up to it later, made board games before designing games in Unity with <br>
                C#, and learning time management and working with and communicating with a team to reach milestones. <br>
                After graduating in May of 2021 I started looking for a job but concluded that I needed <br>
                more experience in my field, so when I saw the description for Quotum Tech, I thought it was <br>
                a good opportunity to gain that experience. One of my goals beyond Quotum is to eventually <br>
                join or start a video game company.
            </p>
