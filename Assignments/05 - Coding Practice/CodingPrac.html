        <p>Went through this one with a for loop in mind but recursion could also work.</p>
        <p>Just have a variable plus equal the iteration until it reaches one less than
            the number inputted, and then return the number plus the sum of that.

        <p>This one enlightened on how js handles dates, I didn't know the months start from 0 to 11.</p>
        <p>I found out that you couldn't just initialize that exact date object and then compare it because of
            object equality, you have to compare the exact copy of the Date object and return it</p>
