      <p>
        Went through this one with a for loop in mind but recursion could also
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just have a variable plus equal the iteration until it reaches one less
        than the number inputted, and then return the number plus the sum of
        that.

      <p>
        This one enlightened on how JS handles dates, I didn't know the months
        start from 0 to 11.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found out that you couldn't just initialize a date object with that
        same date and then compare it because of object equality. You have to
        compare the exact copy of the Date object with that specific date and
        return it.
