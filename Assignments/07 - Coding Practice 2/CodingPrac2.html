      <h3>Coding Challenge #4 - Tuck in Array</h3>

      <p>
        The spread method is very useful for combining not only arrays, but objects as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach was to just return the first element in array1 followed by all the elements
        in array 2, then finally the second element in array 1 to get the correct result4

      <h3>Coding Challenge #5 - A Redundant Function</h3>

      <p>
        I approached this one by looking carefully at the requirements and only returning a function
        that returns a function that returns a string. An easy way to look at it is to see how many
        things need to be returned.

      <h3>Coding Challenge #6 - Matchstick Houses</h3>

      <img src="images/CC6.jpg" alt="CC3" style="width: 80%" />
      <img src="images/CC6 Code.jpg" alt="CC3Code" style="width: 50%" />
      <img src="images/CC6 Success.jpg" alt="CC3Success" style="width: 40%" />

      <p>
        This one was pretty straightforward. All I did was find the formula for the matchstick houses
        and then put in a condition in case it was 0. Also don't forget to put less than or equal to
        instead of just greater than.

      <h3>Coding Challenge #7 - How much is True?</h3>

      <img src="images/CC7.jpg" alt="CC7" style="width: 80%" />
      <img src="images/CC7 Code.jpg" alt="CC7Code" style="width: 50%" />
      <img src="images/CC7 Success.jpg" alt="CC7Success" style="width: 40%" />

      <p>
        This one make you think on how to distinguish between variables that need to be matched
        and ones that do not. I searched for true statements in an if statement and made a count variable
        to show how many were in the array. I then made sure to keep the return statements out of the for loop
        so that it wouldn't prematurely exit.

      <h3>Coding Challenge #8 - Which Generation are You?</h3>

      <img src="images/CC8.jpg" alt="CC8" style="width: 80%" />
      <img src="images/CC8 Code.jpg" alt="CC8Code" style="width: 35%" />
      <img src="images/CC8 Success.jpg" alt="CC8Success" style="width: 40%" />

      <p>
        This one wasn't that difficult, since all you have to do is use the
        arguments defined in the constructor (name, age) and compare them with
        the class methods argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        With each comparison of ages, adjust the sentences until it fits the
        criteria and then return them.
