    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hi! My name is Nigel Clayton, i'm 24 years old and live in Decatur GA.
        I got into coding by taking a HTML elective class in my senior year of highschool and thought
        it was very fun to learn. After highschool, I initially decided to pursue a graphic design degree
        at Kennesaw State University before changing it Game Design and Development in my first year there.
        During my 4 years there leading to graduation, I learned a lot about Java, not really liking at first 
        but warmed up to it later, made board games before designing games in Unity with C#, and learning time 
        management and working with and communicating with a team to reach milestones. 
    </p>
