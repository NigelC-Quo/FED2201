-- Routing ideas (where certain buttons or inputs would lead to)

New Campaign - starts the game, would probably send you to a small cutscene or the tutorial.
Training - sends you to the training stage with its own state.
Arena - starts the arena mode that would have its own state and features.
Stats - opens a modal that would display various stats about the game like playtime, achievements, etc.
Guide - starts the tutorial state that may be more in-depth than the new campaign tutorial.
Options - opens a modal that would let you configure settings like sound, button layout, etc.
Quit - quits the application.

-- Database integration (how you would use AXIOS to make RESTful API calls)

Implement daily challenges that would get its criteria from a database randomly.
Get achievements and unlocks from a database that would trigger from flags.
